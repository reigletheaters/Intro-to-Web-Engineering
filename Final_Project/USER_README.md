## Description 
This website serves as a platform for content creators to display their love for Labrador dogs. This site allows individuals who share similar passions to subscribe to the content creators for exclusive access to their labradors' page and activities. The overall functionality currently displays the labrador image gallery in a grid of 3 columns which stack to one column when resized, fixed position buttons below the header for labrador categories and button for the chat container fixed at the bottom right. The subsribe buttons were set to absolute positioning and incorporated event listeners which after "subsribing", would use the toggle function in the javascript to remove the blurred effect.
